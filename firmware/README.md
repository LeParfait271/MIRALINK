# MiraLink firmware core

This directory contains the new MiraLink firmware core and the first compiled
Pico 2 W hardware target. Protocol framing, configuration validation and the
two-slot flash store are independent of the board layer; the `pico/` target
connects them to USB HID and Pico flash operations without importing any
previous firmware source.

Firmware 0.37 corrects the experimental DualSense-family USB persona after the
0.36 hardware test exposed two controller children in Windows. The single HID
interface now has one root Gamepad Application collection and nests MiraLink
Feature management inside it. It also keeps new Bluetooth addresses provisional
until a complete DualSense input report validates the link and runs CYW43/
BTstack by explicit main-loop polling instead of a competing background IRQ.
These fixes retain the safe
runtime wiring for persisted settings and automatic first-pair Bluetooth:
speaker/headset volume, bounded speaker gain, trigger-effect reduction,
optional unique USB serial exposure, conservative local inactivity suspension
and a disabled-by-default external status GPIO. It retains the local Bluetooth
inquiry/connection path for DualSense input, bounded diagnostics, local RAM
logs, USB reconnection, confirmation-token recovery, native-size DualSense
input/output bridging and opt-in USB remote wake. The UAC2 audio source
remains in the firmware tree but is disabled from the active USB descriptor
until a physical Pico 2 W validation is complete. These paths remain
subject to physical Pico 2 W and controller validation; a successful build is
not a hardware test.

## Core and hardware builds

- `CMakeLists.txt` contains the host-testable core target.
- `pico/CMakeLists.txt` builds the real Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W target with the
  official SDK and local ARM toolchain.
- The current Pico build produces ELF, BIN, HEX and UF2 artifacts.

No board is flashed by any build command.
